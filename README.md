# SALES PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
                                              Introduction of SALES PRICE PREDICTION
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Typically, a productâ€™s sales are primarily dependent on how much you spend on advertising it, as the more people your product reaches, the more sales will increase as long as the quality of your product is good.
